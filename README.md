## Running the project
The game was developed using Stencyl. To run the project you'll need to have this tool installed

the `CC5VFinal` folder is a Stencyl project.

To run it, move this folder to the path specified below (replacing `user_name` to your actual user name) and you should be able to see the project on Stencyl when you open it.

```C:\Users\user_name\stencylworks\games```
